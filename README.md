# 📦 Apartment for Rent — Data Analysis & Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing rental apartment listings and predicting apartment prices using machine learning techniques. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and predictive modeling — all implemented in Python and presented through a Power BI dashboard.

# 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes various attributes of apartment listings, such as:
. Location (latitude, longitude)
. Price
. Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
. Area (square footage)
. Type of listing (e.g., Studio, 1BR, 2BR)

Initial data preprocessing steps included:
. Converting non-standard "null" values to Python-readable NaN
. Removing or filling missing values as appropriate

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Key insights extracted through Python include:
. Distribution of apartment prices by geographic location
. Price trends by number of rooms and area
. Outlier detection and handling
. Correlation between numeric features
