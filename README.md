# 📦 Apartment for Rent — Data Analysis & Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing rental apartment listings and predicting apartment prices using machine learning techniques. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and predictive modeling — all implemented in Python and presented through a Power BI dashboard.

# 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes various attributes of apartment listings, such as:

. Location (latitude, longitude)

. Price
. Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

. Area (square footage)

. Type of listing (e.g., Studio, 1BR, 2BR)

Initial data preprocessing steps included:

. Converting non-standard "null" values to Python-readable NaN

. Removing or filling missing values as appropriate

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Key insights extracted through Python include:

. Distribution of apartment prices by geographic location

. Price trends by number of rooms and area

. Outlier detection and handling

. Correlation between numeric features

# 📈 Power BI Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard was developed to provide interactive and visual insights from the apartment rental dataset.

Key dashboard elements:

. Map View: Displays geographic distribution of rental listings by price and location

. Bar & Column Charts: Show rental trends by number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and apartment types

. Filters: Allow users to slice data by price ranges, locations, and room counts

. KPI Cards: Summarize key metrics such as average price, total listings, and most common apartment types

This dashboard enables users to explore patterns in the rental market visually and interactively.
